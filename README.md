## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the directory of your custom game and change `name` field in `package.json` file to the name of your addon name.
3. Open terminal in that directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies. You also should run `npm update` once in a while to get tool updates.

After that you can run `npm run dev` command in terminal to compile your code and watch for changes.
